setup-scripts
=============

Some setup builders for those old games you want to easily distribute.
You will need the installed game and some resources yourself :(

DawnOfWarDC
-----------

Dawn of War Dark Crusade. This will work mostly out of the box, but I
suggest you add dcunlock (race unlocker), community map pack, and ai
script.

CommandAndConquerGenerals
-------------------------

Command and Conquer Generals. Straightforward/vanilla install.

CommandAndConquerGeneralsZH
---------------------------

Command and Conquer Generals: Zero hour. Needs normal generals
installed beforehand.
